        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil 2 litres of water in a big pot.</li>
            <li>Add good amount of salt, the water should feel fairly salty. But not like sea water salty.</li>
            <li>Put the Sphagetti in the boiling water. <strong>The cooking time is written on the packets of most pastas. <em>Kindly check the instructions.</em> Do not overcook the pasta</strong> </li>

            <li>Cook on low to medium heat. Let the oil be infused with the flavours of the garlic. <strong>Don't burn the garlic.</strong></li>
            <li>After the garlic is cooked, take some pasta water from pot and put in the pot to arrest the cooking. </li>
            <li>Add the spaghetti in the pan and toss well. Add chilli flakes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and enjoy.</li>
